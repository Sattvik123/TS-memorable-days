          Hi, this is about TechSyndicate's App Development program
          <br>
          we are creating apps on VS code, Flutter and Android Studio.
          <br>
          Also we are using Github
          <br>
          -first we installed git for windows on our PCs<br>
          -then we connected our accounts and learnt to clone our repository locally and edit it using VS Code
